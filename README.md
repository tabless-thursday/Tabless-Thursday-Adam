# tabless-thursday App description

*This is the first website I have ever built*

People often have a million tabs up and lose track of what they were doing. This website lets you organize them in to-do lists and make a note of why it was important. Makes it easy to pick up where you left off.

-Organize your open browser tabs into to-do list format
-Add and remove tabs from your saved tabs
-Sign-up/log-in to view your saved tabs and manage to-do lists
